# Final Project Machine Learning - CS 545/445 Winter 2022
# Applying  Machine Learning to Predict Target Customers for a Bank

# Abstract
> ### Using customer data of a Portuguese  banking institution to do prediction.
> ### We build 3 models of machine learning to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit there or not.
> ### Three models: Multiple Layer Perceptron, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Means

# Stacks Used
> ### Numpy: a library for the Python programming language, supporting for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
> ### Matplotlib: a plotting library for the Python programming language. It's a extension of Numpy library.
> ### Pandas: another open source Python package, supporting for data reading, data cleansing, data fill, data inspectation, merges and joins. 
> ### sklearn: a library for machine learning in Python. Sklearn provides efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling.
> ### Tensorflow: a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It focus on training and inference of deep neural networks
> ### Keras: a high-level neural network library that runs on top of TensorFlow
